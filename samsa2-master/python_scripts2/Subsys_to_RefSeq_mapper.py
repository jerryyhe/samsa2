# Subsystems_specific_read_retriever.py
# Created 6/03/2017, this version updated 6/08/2017
# Sam Westreich, stwestreich@ucdavis.edu, github.com/transcript
#
# Purpose: Because all reads processed in the SAMSA database maintain their
# original read ID, it is possible to get results across databases!  For
# example, we can use this program to obtain all reads matching "fucosidase"
# from the Subsystems results and determine their organism of origin in the
# RefSeq results.
#
# This program takes a search term, the Subsystems ".receipt" file, and the
# RefSeq results file as its inputs.  It checks the Subsystems ".receipt"
# file for the search term, finds the corresponding annotations in the RefSeq
# results, and returns those sequences.

# USAGE:
# -S		SEED results			The SEED Subsystems annotation for that sample.
# -I		Original input			The RefSeq results for that sample.
# -O		Output name				Name of saved retrieved sequences file
# -T		search Term				Term to be searched for in results for filtering
